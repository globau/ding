Requires ding.mp3 and error.mp3 in same directory as script.  OSX only.

Syntax: ding [command]

Without a command, ding plays ding.mp3

With a command, ding will execute that command and play ding.mp3 if the command
completed without error, otherwise error.mp3 will be played.

If the command took more than one second to execute, the elapsed time will be
shown.  When invoked as 'ding-ts' (eg. via a symlink), the current time as
hh:mm will also be displayed.
